            Be aware of the high risk of loss involved in trading and/or holding digital currencies. As with any asset, the value of 
            Digital Currencies is unstable, even more highly volatile and there can be substantial risk of losing your money via 
            purchasing, selling, holding, or investing in digital currencies. Due to its decentralisation, digital currency services 
            and additional services are currently not regulated by the central bank of Africa, or any other regulatory bodies in Africa. 
            Your Digital Currencies are not protected by the African financial services or UK financial services compensation scheme as 
            digital currency transaction is under prohibition within Africa. No protection is provided for your Digital Currencies and 
            E-money. Therefore, you should consider whether trading or holding Digital Currencies is suitable for you.
